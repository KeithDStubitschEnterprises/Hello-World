# Hello-World
First Try on GitHub

I am Keith D Stubitsch, and I am trying to learn how to program both in cloud form as well as on the Android platform.
I am doing this to learn how to make learning about the environment entertaining for children and adults alike
I hope to be able to show, through a game how Aqua-Culture (also known as Aquaponics) can sustain current life on Earth
WIth luck, it will be fun and educational at the same time
